# UShort
This is a URL - Shortener which I developed using HTML,CSS and JAVASCRIPT Technologies.

So, the website actually looks like this.

In the textbox available, one can enter the Large URL links and the shortened links are displayed below. 

The button with the label Copy, can be used to copy the shortened links and pasting in the browser results in opening the same as with the long url links.

The API involved in shortening of the links is https://api.shrtco.de/v2/

Also, I developed the Sign in/ Login Page.

This is a Pretty basic website but it can be further extended using Node.js and MySQL where the shortened links can be stored in a database if same url is occured twice then the previous shortened link should be extracted.
